This is what the dark and harsh reality of Re: Zero calls to wake Subaru up from his blind confidence and optimism before the light of hope and darkness of despair. It is a charm of suffering with a vicious substance in the depth of loneliness. The world with shine and gloom bestows one’s fate to realize before his eyes and crawl through the walls of fear. The horror of solitude craves him to curb his fancy by the answer of truth. With answers and consequences, what fate will judge Subaru according to his deeds?\n\nWith his weak yet “immortal’’ ability called Return By Death, Subaru must determine if his hope will either remain him standing or cripple him out till the corner of despair. Lost in the new world, he found his hope to grasp away from the solitude and build up with his smiles and plays as Emilia and others share the bond together. He truly wants to save his friends and comrades to stay away or fight through it, but his fanciful determination will result either in miracle or collapse. His ability considers as a reset button to move forward through a solitary phenomenon for altering his fate and judgment; however, the price of it, such as others’ forgetfulness because of dimensional hopping and the restriction to expose his truth behind the curtain by himself, is intensely flawed — delivering the chance for an alternative resolution within the plot as if he acquitted himself for cleansing his own sins.\n\nTappei did an outstanding job at applying the Law of Equivalent Exchange to his ability, especially his weak physicality — making it a simple yet intense thrill to catch the audience away from its boredom of perfection. The suspense is masterful and consistent based on every context, which makes Re:Zero intriguing to let more fans craft more theories and questions as a layer of curious engagement. Moreover, his character means to be morally gray as he doesn’t look at the other side easily, which means he can be once a foolish and casual person like us to aggress somebody to those who might threaten him or not. He has his own priority, flaws, pride, ways of resolve, and love for Emilia as his “knight in shining armor” personality drives him to be whoever he is. He can cry as a wimpy bastard or a try-hard hero of himself, but his determination grasps it ever since he had been gradually developing by chasing his grit even further with alternative resolution. Through his behavioral process, he manages to be casual without forcing himself to be an uninvited guest in front of a pillar of society. That’s what makes Subaru a human person and a true knight — not his own heroic and fanciful delusions which most people like Ram, Priscilla, and Julius despised him for his amateur overconfidence by his self-importance back from the prequel of this anime adaptation.\n\nHe manages his personality to be uptight and miserable; however, Rem volunteers to be as one whom Subaru will vent out his drastic feeling that flows within him as the time of Episode 18 snaps him out despite resulting in an expected rejection. His vulnerability strikes him to grasp his confidence, but his lack of self-esteem asserts the reason for his failure. For now, he frequently realizes that the world itself doesn’t fulfill his fanciful wishes to become reality at all, which fate matters based on the context he made in the first place. It only works if the ethical standard has been met, and then Subaru will come for the rest. Hence, he is a well-written character. He consistently had gone through the process of Dunning-Kruger effect in a psychological sense based on his character from the midway of Season 1, and right now, we’re still looking forward to its next level…. I mean, this second season.\n\nFrom the reference of Dunning-Kruger effect to the extent of Subaru’s Peak of Stupidity till his Valley of Despair in the first season, the second season will project about his Slope of Enlightenment through the Trial of Sanctuary by Echidna’s lost soul. It tackles more about the diversity of its gloomy atmosphere. The mechanism of reality with unawareness of difference is crucially perilous. Without facing it, there will be no point to gain the courage against others with dreadful courage and competence.\n\nCompared to most isekai series, Re:Zero subverts the common trope into its substantial value for achieving the unique message and formulating the setting to an authentic extent. The overarching plot has been connected, and the premise of this series becomes more lucid. Most characters are compelling to provide their own ideals based on the contextual background, and there are little to no nonsensical tropes to be presented in a big picture.\n\nThere are also new characters being set up to their motive, creating its thickness of plot development, and some side characters are well-reserved for their own plot progression. Most of them aren’t just here to boost Subaru’s morale, they usually have their own priority which provides the importance of their livelihood as the role of themselves and society. Sometimes can be friendly, and sometimes can be contradictory. The “power of friendship” trope is well done with proper foundation of each other’s relationship as if most students are sometimes doubting each other for some tentative reasons. They have their own stories which affect how they have been nurtured ever since behind Subaru’s back, making them relevant in most cases. With proper consistency, it is understandable for audiences to pique their curiosity and craft more hypotheses based on the observation throughout every significant scene.\n\nThe slow pacing of this season did a great job of building up more worldbuilding, character interaction, and lore for serving the premise to its promising level as the plot thickens further with multiple ways to ensure and stabilize the core theme of the story into a complex understanding of every fundamentals in a gradual manner; however there are some scenes that are rushed yet sensible to assert its foundation.\n\nThe story is written in Third-Limited narrative style, which Subaru always owns the spotlight of Re: Zero’s main storyline, and the narrative standpoint matches it up to deliver both contextual factors of shock and suspense. The plot follows in dimensional-hopping theory which most audiences think this is a time-travelling series; hence, it laughs me off whenever I mostly hear of its misconceptions. It fleshes out the message of the story and the concept of Subaru’s purpose and development for living in another world, especially Episode 4, which it also fills the space for making its premise to be more purposeful and adds the mystery or any substantial details on why Subaru was sent to this world to begin with. It also molds Subaru’s self-reflection during the time in his original world for projecting more leniency and understanding about his own character. The poignancy within Season 2 encapsulates and expands all the underlying feelings Subaru had before.\n\nThere are a lot of minor details that have foreshadowed for the future occurrence within a big picture, and there will be more twists to come if you pay close attention to every little detail. These perceptible details throughout the series significantly matter the most for the plot progression to be understandable, and connecting each plot point with sensible pictures is worth engaging to liven the audiences up in a mindblowing extent. Moreover, the story puts so many obstacles and chilling aura as Subaru will face against the odds for his objective to pass the trial and deactivate the barrier of the Sanctuary.\n\nAs a LN reader, I really hope this Arc 4 will give a proper and consistent adaptation since this is the best arc among the rest, and it did; however, there are some slight chances which disappoints me for a bit. Particularly, the animation quality and cut contents clouds me to clench my fist for a while; however, I don’t care about it since I’m all up for this beautiful and eerie story of a psychological drama and thrill in a visual manner because the rollercoaster is on the way. It also reminds me that they might cut some LN contents to avoid an excessive level of exposition dumps, and instead the anime adaptation prioritizes more into “Show, don’t tell” rule… or in other cases, “Show and tell” rule.\n\nThere are also some episodes with dialogue-heavy standards, but it is essential and relevant to its case for building up more consistency and adding the layers of intensity and progression with more directional questions as the anime provides more exploration with subtle explanation.\n\nThe orchestral music hits the thespian or gloomy vibes with a phenomenal melody which enthralls more transverse atmosphere as it pleases our ears to render its theme with consistency. The symbolizing beats are presented well with contextual deliverance. It signals perfectly to every character’s tone as it builds up more aura and meaningfulness around them. Each scene comprises its suitable meaning, which it brings more vigor to express the stimulation between fear and courage. However, I despise that they mostly haven’t provided the time for opening and ending song to present within every episode, yet it also exchanges with more lengthy minutes to catch up the writing size into an essential and almost absolute extent for recognizing the plot progression into a comprehensible standard. Length-wise, it is appreciative to offer each episode with significant impact by providing more projection to adapt.\n\nIn regards to the character section, please be aware of spoilers because I might go detailed for this.\n\n**WARNING: SPOILERS ALERT**\n\nAt first, Frederica is introduced to be a new… or rather a recurring maid, as she formerly served Roswaal before the time of Ram’s duty. Her gentle personality has shown and explained about her professional experience of being Roswaal’s former and latter maid, so it suits her to be a person with decent help as a maid herself. Since there is an effect to forget someone’s existence, it also affects Roswaal to hire two maids, especially Petra. She also establishes a significance about her own character as she trains Petra to be a proper maid and also swear herself by the letter that she only got in her own hands as a hidden background about her — which we will get to know more about her later in the second cour. The twist of events is clear and connected between Rem’s occurrence and the purpose of their introduction; hence, it’s understandable.\n\nHowever, one problem in dialogue-wise, for example, is Petra’s inappropriate response which triggers something abrupt to progress the story in a silly way. Whenever I see her, I always cringe when she often baffles me and other compelling characters with awkward moments throughout every scene; nevertheless, I don’t hate her since she is a kid with potential.\n\nThere is also another new character being introduced with relation to Frederica called Garfiel. Compared to Frederica, his older sibling, Garfiel appears to be a barbarous yet friendly character with strong finesse to begin with. At first, he remains intact and rational to the fact that he slightly cares for other people, especially Arlam Refugees, to have their sojourn. However, because of many loops from Subaru’s deeds, he alters his behavior to assault Subaru (and his other supporters/Arlam Refugees) because he senses an outgrown miasma throughout Subaru’s aura — dictating that he will protect the Sanctuary at all cost. He surely has his own deeds and priority with Ryuzu Shima’s help to establish his significance as a side character who will put himself as an obstacle against Subaru’s odds, making himself relevant to this case.\n\nOn the other hand, Otto has the support for Subaru, Emilia, and the rest of Arlam Refugees. He has the role to provide them with transportation, but it’s not just for that. He also has more responsibility to build more wholesome interaction with Subaru and Garfiel, ensuring himself that he will be in a great place for them — especially Otto saves and impresses Subaru with his timid humor and personality. However, Otto’s wholesome development has been wasted and paid by Subaru’s death loops to alter his destiny for a greater cause, but it doesn’t mean for him to be just a neglected accessory to Subaru’s eyes since Subaru himself wants to hide his burden and lift it up by himself. For now, he has a good potential to be a prominent character, and I hope the second cour will give him more screentime to showcase his significant greatness by helping Subaru out and determining himself to develop out of his comfort zone of timidity.\n\nRoswaal has revealed his importance and plot progression for serving his purpose with the Gospel which also has it with Beatrice, uncovering their agency behind them. Surely, they have a long-time relationship between both of them since they have been residing within the mansion for a long time, and the context makes sense as it is according to the plan. Beatrice, however, has some share of problems with Subaru about her supposed role which clouds her from being isolated. How she conveys her emotional confrontation with Subaru grasps her outstanding chance to vent out her feeling of solitude within her own comfort zone, conserving it to build up more layers about her for the potential development. Beatrice also represents herself as a hermit which makes her an intriguing and realistic symbol of an isolated persona. Similar to Otto’s case of development, she can be a suitable candidate for that as well — looking forward to getting out of her comfort zone.\n\nEchidna is also introduced as the Witch of Greed and a transcendental character by letting Subaru enter the Castle of Dreams. Her cold yet charm-provoking personality shines her gloomy aura to be a likeable and knowledgeable character as if she perceives logic through emotions just as she provides Subaru to confront his own past through his memories for his self-reflection. Her mild support to Subaru by his reminiscence helps the audience to know more about his character and build up a connection between the fantasy and the reality, which makes Episode 4 so special to our own eyes. However, Echidna knows her own goal behind Subaru’s back and stabs it as she teases his intuition with her plan. Her sham and manipulative exaggeration hits the bullseye towards Subaru’s heart which surprises me by her deceiving plan, as her black-hearted aura impresses me more. Her greed and love for knowledge is intelligible. Her sense of hatred and dark humor conveys well, and we’ll see more about it. Thus, I really love her pride and competence of being the Witch of Greed which gives an impact of her neutral strength. Hence, she’s my favorite character.\n\nThe rest of Witches have their unique characteristic based on their respective symbols. However, one of them doesn’t properly present their substance, such as Minerva’s obnoxious personality, and yet the charm of it is still there. The message delivers well to show how Subaru is judged by his own flawed nature and deeds, especially Typhon who projects Subaru’s sin within the depth of his inner core as being a “good” guy doesn’t mean to be truly a sinner. Each of their metaphors are simply considerable with their perceptible charm. Furthermore, we get to know more about Satella who isn’t entirely a “villain” character whom we thought to be, and her self-conflict is a minor point to recognize the value behind something we can’t see.\n\nMeanwhile, Elsa has reappeared once again to achieve her goal by putting herself before Subaru and his friends as their obstacle, making herself as a well-reserved antagonist. From the prequel, we can understand that her goal failed to achieve Emilia’s badge as she retreated from Reinhard’s abrupt help; however, this second season made a reservation for her to reveal her Plan B in a hidden manner. We really don’t know her motives behind the curtain yet, but the second cour will open the curtain for more explanation in a suitable time. Meili Potroute is also reintroduced as a hostile character alongside Elsa, and a minor detail from Season 1 makes a plot twist understandable when you pay close attention to it. Her introduction in scene-wise, however, feels boring yet equitable to play her own part.\n\nIt’s grueling for Subaru to learn from his mistakes and face against the odds as he needs a harsh and gradual realization for his endurance against his obstacles before his eyes. “I know hell” is what creates his words for him to act, and that “hell” is a laudable metaphor to describe his clasp of strength for shouldering the burden and moving forward despite its vicious outcome. The heavy impact throughout his experiences is understandable, which in return, most audiences can connect their empathy with Subaru — conveying more concerns regarding his own concerns. He has a lot of aims to set and stand by himself up for persevering through many ways to alter his fate against itself. He plays the puzzles in which one or multiple moves will tear him down into pieces if he stumbles on the wrong floor, welcoming him to the pit of despair. If not, then there will be a light of hope awaiting towards the end of Sanctuary. Because in the end, the only way for Subaru to fix the situation is to fix himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Emilia will also face the trial by facing her tragic past that is still behind the curtains yet. For this season, we finally see her worthwhile flaw from being a “perfect” girl. Its twisted helplessness cripples her pragmatic mind in a discordant extent from bearing what comes before her as if she has been taking a lot of Math exams and being overly preoccupied by her restless yet twisted cloud of effort. Her uncontrolled state gives the impact to pull her away from blind of kindness.\n\nThere is no world where we can escape that loneliness without changing the core.\n\n***SPOILERS END***\n\nIn regards to animation, there are some episodes, especially Episode 6 and 12, which have rigid proportions and movements as if some animators have a hard time rendering the sketches due to some bit of miscommunication amid the quarantine period. This is one of a problematic category which slightly baffles me to enjoy less than the quality in Season 1. Some erroneous frames and CGI renditions can be noticeable for most audiences to identify its upsetting quality. Whenever I rewatch these scenes, I’d rather grab my dumbbells and do the squats to sweat out my frustration, and I’m not also the type who will just cross my eyes and say “Fine!”. Nonetheless, it’s still fine if the adaptation is faithfully well-done which it is truly as it is.\n\nOverall, this anime adaptation has exceptional results to capture its aesthetic value to a further extent. As Season 1 delivers some weak conclusions within the second half, the first cour of Season 2 provides a high slope of twist to let the audience rise for an engaging rollercoaster ride. Oh, boy! It punches right through the feels with sensible foundation as this show serves like a dark chocolate with 25% of sweetness. The worldbuilding here is excellent as it builds up more atmosphere into a thematic balance between light and dark. Re: Zero is packed with epitome of suffering, perseverance for truth and doubts, horror of loneliness, and substantial depth of self-reflection through the mastery of melodrama with contextual deliverance. Forcing Subaru to confront the consequences of his many deaths is a masterstroke for the series, even before you consider the terrifying and heart wrenching way in which it was delivered. While Re:Zero is great at genuine horror and gore, it is in the psychological terror that this show truly shines. I can safely say that it deserves more acclaim because this season fills up more layers from what it lacks in Season 1, and it has fulfilled the promise. All I do right now is to sit back and relax to enjoy my smiles and frowns while connecting myself through its excellent narration with indulgence of an outstanding cliffhanger. If there will be a single teaser for Season 3 adaptation, I will moan and cry for it. Hence, it’s my all-time favorite anime. This show is highly recommendable if you already have watched Season 1.\n\nAs the first cour offers more questions, will the second cour answer them?\n\nTo be continued in Winter 2021!"},{"id":7889,"score":95,"summary":"FR Surpasser toute les attentes avec cette deuxième saison ?","body":"Nous y voila la deuxième saison de Re : zéro qui nous aura fais poiroter 4 bonnes années. Alors ? et bien elle vient écraser la première saison d'une façons explicable que je vais développer d'une autre manière que mes autres reviews en faisant un gros paragraphe.\n__~~~INTRODUCTION~~~__\nOn c’était arrêter donc quand Emilia a sortis la fameuse phrase : Qui est Rem ? Qui entraina une vague d'indignation chez nous. Les deux nouveau personnages qui me font grand intérêt sont les deux nouveaux sorciers __Regulus Cornea__ qui est L'avarice, puis son compère __Ley __Batenkaitos  qui est du registre de la gourmandise et qui va user de son autorité pour faire disparaitre rem des mémoires.\n\nOn va donc commencer une nouvelle tourmente pour Subaru qui provient du Tombeau de la sorcière de l'avarice Echidna. Garfiel va garder tout le monde globalement dans le sanctuaire qui est protéger par une barrière car il ne peuvent pas en sortir sauf les humains qui peuvent sortir comme ils veulent . Emilia va donc devoir passer les tests du Tombeau tandis que Subaru va pouvoir également les faire. \nJe vais maintenant résume l'anime avec les 3 grands problème majeur de Subaru : Le problème du manoir, le tombeau, le Grand Laphydre \nOn va maintenant parler des personnages leur rôles dans ces évévénements et leur impact sur la saison \n__~~~PERSONNAGE~~~__\nOn va débuter par __ Echidna__  elle est devenu la sauveuse de Subaru après que elle soit devenu la première a être au courant du pouvoir de Subaru avec une scène très touchante et une délivrance sans noms. Elle semble aussi avoir toujours un temps d'avance sur tout le monde elle recèle tellement de savoir que cela est même inquiétant.. Je vais la relier a présent a un autre personnage qui est __Béatrice __; Beaco a été extrêmement explicité cette saison : elle obéit a un livre qui dicte son avenir mais on apprends que celui la ne lui dit plus rien depuis 400 années.. Elle attendais un élue qui devait le libérer de ses chaines et Subaru même si il ne semble pas être cette personne va être contraint d'assister a une decheance de l'esprit de Béatrice qui nous a parut toujours très forte et puissante accompagnés de sa mort contre Elsa et Meili [ la petite fille du village au cheveu bleue] Beatrice peut être sauvée il le faut. \n\nOn fais  la connaissance de __Frederica __une Maid de Roswaal qui recèle encore un bon nombre de secret. \nOn va entamer l'arc du fameux sanctuaire ou on va faire la rencontre de __Garfiel __et __Ryuuzu __deux personnages qui vont être très important dans la deuxième partie de 2021.\nGarfiel est un apôtre déjà. Il a encore beaaaucoup de secret qui vont être révéler je pense a la prochaine saison mais il est très énigmatique alors que __Ryuuzu __ on apprend que elle est une expérience de Echidna et que le labo que Subaru a trouvé provient de echidna pour quelle transfère sa conscience dans un de ces corps mais soldé par un échec elle a peu être un résultat avec Lewes qui est enfermer dans un conteneur \n\n__Ram __et __Rem __n'ont pas été le centre de cette saison il n'y a peu de chose a dire sauf 1 sur Rem qui je discuterais après\n\n___Roswaal_ __a joué un rôle très important dans cette saison car déjà il est au courant pour le pouvoir de subaru mais pas totalement : il ne sais pas qu'il faut que baru meurt pour retourner dans un point de sauvegarde il pense qu'il peut juste retourner dans le passé.Il suit lui aussi comme Béatrice le fameux livre comme un évangile. A la fin on apprends que c lui qui a décide de engager Elsa pour attaquer son château.. Tout cela pour renforcer la détermination de Subaru et le poussé a lâcher quelle que chose il essaye de transformer notre Jeune garçons en une personne qui perd son Humanité et devienne comme Roswaal comme il l'a dit plusieurs fois il est totalement fou a lier, mais je pense qu'il reste un personnages plus que intéressant et que peut être la saison prochaine nous permettra de mieux comprendre \n\nOn a fais la connaissance de 6 sorcières : __Typhon __sorcière de l'orgueil qui est un enfant tout mignon en apparence mais qui possède une autorité très puissante de déchirè les parties du corps des individus si ils sont coupable de quelle que choses même si il se déteste eu même par exemple \n__Satella __que je vais parler après, __Echidna__, __Minerve __la sorcière de la colère qui est tout le temps en pleure mais paradoxalement elle peut tout aussi bien détruire que guérir avec sont autorité, __Carmilla __la luxure que je vais développer en rejoignant avec rem : Subaru a passé la deuxième épreuve que je vais expliquer plus tard et a la fin il voit rem qui le console et lui dit de se reposer,cependant c'est Carmilla qui a voulu lui montrer la personne que subaru pensait le plus afin de surmonter cette épreuve.. \nEnsuite __Shekmet __la paresse qui est assez dans son coin et que  va être plus amener au devant de la scène enfin je l'espère\n \npour finir __Daphnee __qui est au centre de l'histoire ici : c'est elle qui a créer le grand Laphydre La baleine et le serpent subaru va donc devoir la confrontée pour savoir pourquoi a t-elle créer tout cela avec un raisonnement que j'ai trouvé sympa sur la faim dans le monde, elle les a créer surtout pour faire disparaitre les famines mais dans quelle sens ? en supprimant la famine en tant que t-elle ou les personnes qui en souffrent ? Bref Les 7 sorcières sont tellement intéressantes que j’aimerais limite un oav basée sur chacune d’entre elle.\n  \nSatella a présent : Elle dispose d'un amour sans nom pour Subaru ce qui est même terrifiant car elle peut tuer n'importe qui pour lui mais au dernier épisode il y a eu une discussion plus censée entre elle et Subaru : Elle lui dit clairement que le fait que il utilise autant la mort la chagrine et surtout : que Subaru doit s'aimer davantage sans faire du mal au gens qu'il aiment ce qui nous fais poser 100000 questions ? Satela est elle gentil au final ? Pourquoi a t-elle tuer ces congénères ? Pourquoi dans la première saison elle écrasait le cœur de Subaru ? J'ai une théorie : Satella est peux être Emilia dans le futur ou une choses qui se rapporte car Satella n'a jamais fais de mal a Subaru physiquement parlant elle semblait tellement triste de le voir mourir a chaque fois mais bref sa reste une théorie peux construire mais bref ce personnage est magique surtout quand elle lui demande a subaru de la tuer a la fin de sa quête ??? Bref vivement la suite\n\n__Emilia __a présent est entre autre celle qui va causer indirectement les 3 problèmes : Il a une pression énorme sur les épaules avec le fait qu'elle doit réussir les épreuves pour que tout le monde rentres chez eux ce qui va la rendre folle : Subaru après le tragique événement de Beatrice va voir Emilia et on voit quelle se fait consumer par la folie elle se transforme en Satela peux être.. ? Le premiers problème est ici comment faire pour ne pas plonger Emilia dans la folie ? Surtout que il a Roswaal comme ennemie ; il va faire tomber de la neige pour faire rappeler au villageois ( se référer a l'oav de emilia ) un tragique evenement qui vont les pousser a isoler emilia et la rendre encore plus seul. Le manoir est attquer pour que subaru reste envers emilia puis le grand lapydre est présent c un gigantesque problème subaru va t’il sacrifié le manoir ? attaqué le grand Laphydre ? Laisser Emilia seul ?\n\n A présent et pour compléter cette longue review __Subaru __:  Première action qui montre enfin le changement chez Subaru après ce triste évènement de la disparation de Rem est le suicide et je m'explique car oui il a déjà eu une action morbide de la sorte dans la première saison avec la falaise : le meurtre avec une arme blanche est beaucoup plus dur que le simple fais de se jeter d'une falaise Subaru comprends qu'il doit changer certains choses chez lui pour que tout le monde soit en paix mais cela a une grande répercussion que je parlerais plus tard. on va enfin en savoir plus sur le passé de Subaru qui sont ses parents, quelle étaient son train de vie avant tout cela, pourquoi a t-il autant peu confiance en lui pourquoi est-il s'y content de se retrouver dans un nouveau monde ? Bref le devellopement du personnages et l'histoire prends une tournure très  bonnes alors que nous somme que au premiers épisode. Il va cependant perdre la raison a la suite d\"une mort horrible qui est Le Grand Laphydre donc déchiqueter vivant.. Echidna va le sauver et c ici qu'il avoue son secret de la mort réversible.. Subaru est plus déterminé que jamais a sauver tout le monde sauf que il n’hésite plus a se suicider alors que satela est contre cela et c en partie grâce a elle et quand même les autres que Subaru va revoir son jugement et voir qu'il est aimé : La deuxième épreuve consiste a voir ce qu'il se passe quand subaru mourrais comment il peut faire du mal  au gens qui l'entourent, que se tuer n'est pas la solution et que non etre celui qui douille le plus n'est pas une excuses pour se lamenter . Il a une pression enorme sur les épaules lui aussi mais il doit avancer. Au final il refusent a Echidna un contrat qui etais basée sur la destruction de son Humanité en se tuant en boucle certe mais avec un futur convenable alors que Satela souhaite l'inverse. Echidna reste tres interressante et rempli bien le role de l'Avarice\n\n__~~~CONCLUSION~~~__\n Re: Zero est un anime qui a commencer avec une premiere saison bonne mais avec des defauts, la deuxieme saison vient tout remplacer en nous laissant certe des questions mais de bonne questions qui donnent une hype sans nom. Je pense que c'est clairement l'anime de l'année en tout cas de la saison.\n__"},{"id":7897,"score":95,"summary":"\"I know hell. I've seen it many times.\"  -Natsuki Subaru","body":"~~~img700(https://hikarinoakariost.info/wp-content/uploads/nuevo/2020/08/117174216_3337225772964147_3046226613902668490_o.jpg)\n~~~\nRe:Zero is one of the few anime sequels that is filled with unique combinations of many intriguing concepts, human ideologies, realistic emotions, unique world-building, psychological horror, that takes place in a fantasy world. It's had these moments that genuinely gave me goosebumps with its overall presentation of psychological-depth horror, while also adding in bits and pieces of nostalgic, emotional, and heartwarming moments through the eyes, of our main boy, Subaru, and with many more in-depth, important, and fleshed-out characters. Through progression of time, Subaru has been in a state of cold isolation, depression, and suicide, while always recklessly preserving through destiny and fate itself, all for the sake of those he cherishes. However, this season of Re:Zero isn't mainly about a tragic hero trying to save his loved ones. The limelight is more focused on complex and deep topics like the reality of solitude, loneliness, acceptance, cruelty, self-worth, and manipulation while also tackling heroism, determination, resolve, trust, and responsibility.\n\n After being sent into Echidna's Windows XP background, Subaru seems to be more familiar with his position in reality. He's already experienced death itself, suffering, and despair while also experiencing the feeling of accomplishment, happiness, and affection for Emilia and Rem. Subaru's power, \"Return by Death\", seems to have been blessing or a miracle to him. Being able to change one's destiny and future is what led him to save his loved ones from a cursed reality.\n\n\n\n~~~__But did he ever save himself?__~~~\n\n\n\nSubaru is a fine example of how to write a flawed character. Even though his ideology is very similar to that of a shounen protagonist, wanting to save and protect those he cares about, his experiences with many introduced characters like Echidna have shaped him into who he has become. This season is more focused on the Sanctuary's trial, or Echidna's trial's, Subaru, in a way, is very similar to Echidna, being greedy and selfish. She's manipulative, like Satella. However, it's still a fact that she \"shares'\" the burden with Subaru. But in reality, the story presents that Subaru was being selfish and greedy for many different reasons. He's been in a state of cold isolation, depression, and suicide. Echidna, being the witch of greed, is essentially greedy for her own entire existence, being thirsty  for knowledge of the vast world, which leads to how manipulative she can be. Subaru's standpoint includes how he was greedy to save others, not himself, but from the fact that he was lost, confused, scared, and clouded by his power, \"Return by Death\" led to his own judgement of constantly dying, suffering, and sacrificing himself, not knowing how much personal turmoil had taken over his own existence. While Subaru was able to have endurance against reality, was he able to accept himself first, rather than others? Can Subaru trust those who have changed his life? Was he able to accept the reality forced onto him? While all these questions flooded my head, I can still say that Subaru has a good sense of determination in his heart. He has genuine intentions and motivations while at the same time, maintaining his realistic persona and questionable decision-making. But it's also a fact that Subaru has his fair share of flaws as a character. He's overconfident at many things he tries to do, which is rather a given and logical for having a power like \"Return by Death.\" With Subaru's character in play, he is a perfect fit for the overall theme of Re:Zero. He isn't written in a way that makes you want to inherently feel bad for him, but rather to envoke that...\n\n~~~ __He's just tired and lost in a horrid reality.__ ~~~\n\n\nHe's been doubtful of himself because of the regret that had flooded his heart, but he's been able to overcome his misgivings.This season of Re:Zero wanted to emphasize that he hasn't __yet fully overcome__ his obstacles before him. Subaru has been isolated and chained away by what seems to be unbreakable barriers, but he was never technically \"alone.\" He's followed a path that has allowed him to gain friendships. But he's also had so much personal problems and turmoils that, unfortunately, not many will ever understand his feelings and hatred because of the barriers that have ensnared him. __ Subaru, then goes through some of the most painful shit I have seen. It's genius though, the fact him going through so much shit makes it so relatable because at the of the day, It's just how real life is, right? From my personal experiences in life, I can say no person in my life will probably understand __everything__ I have experienced in the my past. People don't have to understand one another in order to sympathize with each other. I mean, look at Rem, she doesn't know about Subaru's power __yet__ she was able to release the chains and barriers that have locked Subaru, and was able to share the burden with him. The anime community has been emotionally impacted because of the amount of credibility and weight Subaru's overall story holds.__ Subaru's been through so many phases. He has wanted to give up, because of how fucked-up everything is, but he can't.__ Personally speaking, I've never resonated with character so much  until I laid my eyes upon Subaru. Even though he wants to give up, he has __no choice__ but to keep on living for the sake of those he adores. He essentially goes crazy and insane beyond human emotion. And after all of this, It's felt as though he's been the only one that has shattered and being torn apart by his power, but reality kicks in, then, the realization that came into his mind flung into him saying, __\"You think you were the only one suffering by your power?\"__ And at the end of season, he finally learns the weight of his misgivings about the reality he was forced into by essentially admitting...\n\n~~~__\"I don't want to die.\"__~~~\n\n__It's scary, you know? Even though Subaru knows that he is loved by others, he still feels alone at many times during the series. It's even more terrifying then the fact that knowing you are alone, but no one understands you.__ \nMajor elements like anxiety, \"love\", and insecurity are constantly present during the show which adds many toppings and layers to the psychological horror of Re:Zero.\n\nSubaru's overconfidence manipulated him to believe in a fake reality where he's a \"wise\" man. But no, Subaru was just lost in a endless loop of hell and terrified of the vast world full of hostility pointed right at him.\n\nBut as the story progresses, and as Re:Zero as a whole, Subaru has resisted constant temptation right at his hands, wanting him to die over and over again. Thankfully,  it's safe to say that while it may seem that Subaru has been through hell itself, he has definitely chosen the path that's best for him because of all the personal battles he has fought in the past, that being himself. He's starting to develop in a more realistic and relatable way throughout the series from the results of last season, and man, the payoff in Episode 4 was presented in a satisfying way, with bits and pieces of nostalgia.\n\nWatching this season of Re:Zero partly felt like connecting a huge puzzle.  Major loose-ends were being tied together throughout the progression of the story, which really put a smile on my face. The overall storytelling and plot progression really brought impact and complexity to the story. I started to understand its lore and premise much better by how it emphasizes on characterization. Examples being the ideology and motivations of Roswaal and Echidna. I was impressed by the world-building that the story managed to introduce, which was one of the major factors that allowed the story to evolve into something much more. Examples being the introduction of the \"Great Rabbit.\" Re:Zero managed to bring more importance and thrill to characterization, world-building, foreshadowing, and to its narrative. The intensive dialogue occurring in Re:Zero brought amazing suspense, fluidity, and thrill with each scene. It delivers clear and shocking cliffhangers every episode. It doesn't rely on one gimmick but rather progresses the story instead, without leaving the viewer behind. \n\n__Re:Zero knows its main attraction and their main set of viewers so well.__\n\nFrom my perspective, Echidna seems more to be like a mother to Subaru. She's very observant of him, she's helped him with his past, yet their relationship is that of like a bank account. Roswaal seems to be more of a father-figure towards Subaru. He wants him to follow the same path he went through, yet it is shown that he and Subaru were never clearly on the same page in the story. Finally, we are met with the reality shows that Echidna and Roswaal sees Subaru as a tool, nothing more, nothing less\n\n\nRe:Zero has a good balance of everything. It isn't overly dramatic, nor isn't underwhelming. Important factors like these make headway for the overall foundation and theme of the story, leaning more towards the suspenseful side. Each buildup going on in the sequence is what really carried the suspense. For example, the buildup of Echidna's monologue brought to the story was thought-provoking and shockingly impactful to the overall theme of the story. Before reading further __I ask that you read Echidna's Monologue from the novel below. It is a solid monologue that really emphasizes on the theme of season 2's story.-it's worth your time! __ Re:Zero had many insane and thrilling scenes that added spice to the plot, it still managed to stay on track with keeping it's overall theme present throughout the entire story. The story managed to establish meaningful relationships between characters such as Subaru with Otto, Emilia, Roswaal, Beatrice, Echidna, and Satella. Specifically Roswaal, holy shit, I was in awe of how crooked and complex his ideology was. He seemed fishy a lot throughout the first season, but I usually put him off the hook most of the time. And I'm glad I did. My god, Roswaal. What a mad lad. \n\n\n__Negatives:__If I were to talk about the overall negating factors of Re:Zero, it would most likely be the fact it may be \"too\" dialogue-heavy for many viewers, as for me though, the dialogue really made this season of Re:Zero memorable to me specifically because of Echidna's Monologue, Roswaal's Intentions, and Subaru's backstory. It really touched and supported the driving force of Re:Zero which is check in my book. There are certain times within the anime where moments were too complex-focused, especially with the dialogue, which may overcomplicate the narrative of the storytelling, which is understandable to me and probably you as well. Because of these negating factors, there weren't as much action-driven scenes like before, but rather more focused on dialogue, backstories, and cleaning up loose-ends of the anime, which is the correct way to avoid major plot holes to the story. Also to say that if you can't get past Subaru's overall character through the series, one may say that he himself could be a negating factor of the series, which I heavily disagree with. \n\n__Animation wise__ I was rather impressed by the visuals seen in Subaru's backstory because of how nostalgic the overall atmosphere was, which is an amazing combination to the music. Because of this, the highlights of this season would have to be Episode 4 and Episodes 12-13. Specifically, what caught my eye was rather the soundtrack, opening, and ending themes. I'm very delighted to see that the producers didn't change most of the OST's due to the fact that it emphasizes so much on Subaru's character and development and the whole vibe of Re:Zero. Seeing the opening theme for Re:Zero made me nostalgic. I don't know why, but probably because of how memorable the moments from season 1 were to me due to the flashbacks constantly being thrown in into the visuals. \n\n__Sound Wise__, The reason why I probably got the goosebumps was mainly because of Satella's voice. It genuinely made my skin vibrate, especially when I was watching with my headphones on, it truly gave me the chills like when I tried watching ASMR videos.\n\nOverall, It's safe to say that ever since the start of season 1, Re:Zero truly has a charm of its own.The franchise itself has managed to bring unique concepts and ideas to the table, while gaining a loyal fandom and immense popularity. Re:Zero stays consistent and entertaining because of all the slowly and thought-out ideas it manages to introduce. Re:Zero stays honest and true to itself, giving us a long-awaited sequel that tops its successor, which truly is a delight to witness. Re:Zero knows how to used the word, \"unpredictability.\" It takes an immeasurable amounts of twists and turns with its characters, action sequences, and plot twists. Garfiel, Roswaal, Beatrice, Satella, and Echidna being a fine example of this. You can't really tell who is \"righteous\" or \"evil\" firsthand through Subaru's perspective because of the many new characters involved and how mysterious some characters are that were already introduced back in the first season. There's still many questions that haven't been answered __yet__ in Re:Zero, and that precisely why it keeps me so entertained and focused on how the story progresses as a whole. All in all, __If you dislike Re:Zero s1 as a whole, I probably won't recommend this show to you because of how much complexity and dialogue is added to the story. To people who want to understand how thought-provoking Re:Zero s2 is, I highly recommend that you rewatch this season to further your understanding of  how the anime progresses. Maybe not right away, but be sure to come back. Don't fret, the rewatch value of this anime is pretty damn nice to say so myself.__  And as a huge fan of this anime, I'm very excited and thrilled to see what Re:Zero has to offer in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~__Echidna's  Monologue:(novel version)__~~~\n__\"-This extraordinary ability you possess, the Authority of Return by Death: Its utility is something you don’t yet truly comprehend. By refusing to allow endings that are contrary to your desires, you repeatedly retry, and repeatedly reach for the future―― that is the near-perfect ideal of an inquirer. But of course. In the first place, once an event has reached its outcome, it would mean that no other outcome could take its place. While in the process of reaching an outcome, it is possible to hypothesize on various possibilities of what that outcome may be. Such an approach under such conditions can serve to verify such various hypotheses. But when there is an actual result you want to reach, the outcome of each experiment and the hypothesis it verifies must forever remain singular. All the while, to truly reproduce the exact same conditions is impossible. No matter how meticulous the preparation, deviation from the conditions of that particular point in time is inevitable. And so too, is the question: “What would the results have been if I had done things differently?”―― forever out of the reach of an inquirer such as myself, instead being what you’d call a dream beyond a dream. Possessing the “Memories of the World”, there are indeed ways in which I could come to “Know” the answers. But while they exist, I have no desire to use or rely on such methods. My “Desire to Know” is not simply a “Desire to Have Knowledge”. Even for me, that distinction is quite a contradictory and loathsome thing. But I’m getting carried away, let’s return to the topic at hand…… for one such as myself, with no choice but to accept the singularity of the outcomes, having but one means of observation, your existence and your Authority is a godsend. Using “The Same Conditions” to conduct “A Different Test”, and see “A Different Outcome” from “What Originally Should Have Been”―― who would not desire such ultimate Authority? Seeing it laid before one’s eyes, who could go without first trying absolutely everything? Of course, I have no intention of taking it by force. In the end, you will be making full use of Return by Death for your purposes. I will ensure that you reach your desired future to the absolute best of my ability. And, in the process, if possible, I would like to sate my curiosity to the fullest possible extent. Surely, you won’t fault me for such a measly request? You will get your answers. I will sate my curiosity. Our interests are entirely aligned. Since I don’t know the answers myself, I certainly won’t misguide you on purpose towards the most wretched endings possible. When first encountering a problem, I’ll be just as ignorant as you are to what the optimal solution may be. So together, we will ponder, agonize and find the answers as comrades. I can say this without the slightest embarrassment. I am immensely fond of you, that is, for your capacity to increase my means of inquiry, and I swear I will never do anything to impede you. Of course, when initially without answers, I cannot guarantee a smooth resolution to every problem even with my help. While I can aid you with the strength of my knowledge, I can never directly interfere with reality. Should the obstacle before you require physical, material strength, I cannot help you. Time after time, perhaps in the hundreds and thousands, your mind and body may be shattered and torn. But if and when it is, I will faithfully tend to your heart. I must admit that not wanting to lose something as useful as you has a part to do with it. But, my fondness for you, and my intention to lend you my strength is genuine. I hope you won’t think badly of me. Though I’ve said this over and over, I am confident that I will prove valuable to achieving your purposes. Indeed, just as I will be, in a sense, using you to satisfy the Greed of my curiosity, you can also use me to “Attain Your Perfect Future”. It is precisely my wish to become that convenient girl you can always call on. If it means spurring you onward, then I will gladly offer you my very existence. Although, paltry as it is, seeing how I’m already dead, whether you will have me is another question. Alas, I suppose that would be unfair to those girls within your thoughts. The subjects of your longing―― the silver-haired Half-Elf, and the blue-haired Demon: the girls that your heart has sworn to save and protect. I won’t go into what I think about the intense emotions you feel towards them, but I will simply say this: The barricade standing before you is far greater than you could possibly imagine. Just the obstacles you are aware of now already have you struggling at your wit’s end. While your resolve to overcome them alone is admirable, it would be far too desperate a fight. There is not the slightest falsehood in my desire to lend you my help. And you have every reason to make use of my willingness. You must use everything you have, use everything you can, and only then can you save the ones you hold dear. Isn’t that the oath you have sworn, and the conviction you took onto the painful path you have chosen? That is why I challenge you, repeat with you, and feel for you. The path you have sacrificed your lives to forge, as ironic as it is, has now been validated in the form of the Second Trial. Perhaps, the Trial might offer the illusion that it existed to make you understand the nature of the path you have walked, and as such, was necessary. Yet the truth is it wasn’t necessary, and those scenes in fact only served to wear down your heart. However, between a state of ignorance and a state of knowing, no matter how appalling the truth may be, I will always value the latter. You have, and will continue to use your life as the price for Returning by Death and for inching ever closer to the future. As you do so, you will constantly keep in the back of your mind the possibility that the sacrifices you have made and those worlds themselves “Might Still Exist” in some form or another. Until one day, you will cease to feel anything about paying with your life, your human emotions will have faded away, the deaths of the people precious to you will no longer strike upon your heart, and so drowning your days in unmovable, emotionless apathy, even if you eventually reach that perfect future, there would be nothing left of you to hold it―― therefore, in order to avoid drifting into a future in which only that tediousness remains, this is necessary. Indeed, there is not a single useless thing in this world, every path is necessary, everything is an indispensable piece of the puzzle: It was for you to understand this that the Trial existed. If you need to make sense of the reasons why you have now stopped in your tracks, then you can think of it this way. And I will affirm your thoughts. If my words can give you the strength to move forward, then I will endeavor to give them. Be it consolation, incitement, whispers of love, or evocations of contempt, if it can become your strength then I will not hesitate to use it. You might hate it, but you will certainly need me on your path ahead. If you are to proceed along this road of unavoidable pain and solitude, then you will need someone to walk alongside you who will never veer their sight from the path. If you leave this role to me and to no one else, then I am willing to walk this road alongside you without question. I will repeat it, I will restate it, I will convey it as many times as necessary until it reaches you. ――You need me. And I need you. I need you immensely. My curiosity can no longer be quenched by anything except you. You are the only one in existence who can satisfy me. My insatiable Greed would be fulfilled by you alone. Your existence is already indispensable to me in this closed-off world. If you wish to be someone else’s hope and use your power to slice open their world, could you not take pity on my miserable self so that I may partake in the fallen scraps as well? If you will bequeath me this kindness, then without a moment’s hesitation, I will offer up my body, my knowledge and my soul. And so I beg of you. Please trust me. That I haven’t told you my true feelings until now was never because I wanted to deceive you. I was merely waiting for the right moment to do so. At this stage, the instant I appealed to you with even a fragment of my true intentions, you surely would have left me. That would have been an unbearable loss to me. And of course, for you as well, as it would certainly be a loss in the sense that you’d be distancing yourself from the future you seek. Although, with the power of Return by Death, you will inevitably reach your desired future. Nevertheless, it will certainly be preferable to reach that future while paying as little in compensation as possible. With me, with me you can lighten that price. I do not want you to make the mistake of thinking that this means as long as you reach the desired future, the greater good can overrule the lesser and the details can be held in contempt. Indeed, falling into temptation and failing to advise you of the optimal path just so I can see the end of a thread―― is not something which I am so confident in my control over my desires that I can guarantee will never happen. This I will admit. But, I will never mislead you. If on the off-chance I do betray your trust in this way, I will under no circumstances try to hide it from you. I will certainly disclose it. And then, do everything in my power to repair that damaged trust. No matter what happens, I will deliver you to the perfect future you desire. Absolutely, absolutely. And now, if you agree that this is necessary, then won’t you choose me? All I want from you, all I ask of you is as I have mentioned in the contract. After that, it is simply a matter of how much suffering you are willing to endure for your desired, coveted wish. I have told you my resolve. Now I would like to hear yours. Prove it to me, seal this contract with me, enlist my assistance, and muster the will to reach your destined future. Do so, and you may for the first time boast that you have conquered the Second Trial. From there, proceed to the Third Trial, and overcoming that, liberate the Sanctuary. Then, considering the disaster that will befall the Sanctuary, those you love, and those you hold dear, that shall be greatest Trial of all. Show me that you have the strength and resolve to surmount it. Once you do, plunder me, use my knowledge, and take hold of the future ahead. What I desire from you, what I request from you, and what I offer you in return is as I have stated. All is as I have sincerely, honestly, willingly confessed it. So now, I want you to tell me―― what is your decision? That, in itself, would satisfy a portion of my curiosity.\"__ -Echidna\n\n__A lovely smile rose onto Echidona’s face.__\n\n__With her white, snow-like hair swaying and her cheeks flushed red from the heat of passion, she turned up her eyes to Subaru, awaiting his answer.__\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my review."},{"id":7919,"score":82,"summary":"Realize your truth and endure until you reach your desired path","body":"ReZero season two made me pick up the light novel ( my first time reading a light novel and I LOVE IT)  The opening of rezero for this season sums up perfectly what Subaru has to do on the next installment of his journey! He must realize the optimal path and seize victory at all costs. Subaru has to face his biggest obstacle yet and literally suffers more than he can even imagine. What I enjoyed about this season is how much Subaru had to reconsider his methods to his madness and realize the consequences of his actions. His power is a double edged sword and for the first time since he came to this word he has to figure out the best way to use it and not lose his sanity and himself simultaneously.  \nSubaru had to face the one thing he never wanted to think about, how his deaths affect his loved ones. How can they accept Subaru (their friend/hero/love interest) as a sacrificial tool to save everyone else?\n\nI initially hated Subaru because initially, it appeared like he purposely let his self-hate and ego get the best of him. This season explains why Subaru is such a weirdo, he doesn't love himself. He thinks everyone else is more valuable than him and think no one would miss him if something were to happen to him. Hence why he chooses to be this bigger than life personality even when he's faced with danger and fear. The flashback made me realize Subaru is just trying to love himself and overcome his insecurities without proper guidance. This time Subaru can't just fix everything just by sacrificing himself, he needs to actually use his head. \nI love the new cast, the more time we spend with the people of the sanctuary, the more I feel I can relate to them. A lot of characters in rezero are haunted by their past and forced to develop traits to help them cope with their fears and insecurities.If you took out even a single supporting character or switched up the roles, the entire story would change. I really enjoyed how this cast added to the existing dynamic of Subaru, Emilia, ram, etc. It's not often I get interested in discovering a character's past and powers as I do with rezero.\n\nThe eerie music and moments sent chills down my spine. The weakest part of this adaptation is how they cut out certain scenes and character moments. I know there's a 24-minute time limit but certain scenes would add to the reasoning behind character motives and making certain scenes more IMPACTFUL. ReZero second season does a good job adapting the light novel material, it was easy to transition between the two to see what content got cut out. The ending theme got perfectly timed each episode to the point, I was compelled to theorize what could happen next. I see why the echidna speech and some of the witches' dialogue got cut but some of it should have been there. Having source material and tons of character-heavy dialogue, monologues and thoughts must be challenging to deal with. If it wasn't for this adaptation, I'd never experience the greatness that is rezero.\n\nI highly recommend watching the second season if you enjoyed the first season, it's a shame the cour got split last minute. That being said you could pick up the light novel or web novel while you wait for the remaining episodes. If you aren't a fan of psychological horror, character-driven stories filled with lots of dialogue, I can't recommend this series to you. That being said I think this season solidified why rezero blew up in 2016, it's something everyone (whose willing) should experience at least once. I think this section of rezero is more interesting compared the last one, we got more questions and some of the hints to the answers we seek,"}],"siteUrl":"https://anilist.co/anime/108632","autoCreateForumThread":true,"modNotes":null,"stats":{"scoreDistribution":[{"score":10,"amount":161},{"score":20,"amount":47},{"score":30,"amount":106},{"score":40,"amount":170},{"score":50,"amount":321},{"score":60,"amount":594},{"score":70,"amount":1826},{"score":80,"amount":4689},{"score":90,"amount":7451},{"score":100,"amount":5637}],"statusDistribution":[{"status":"CURRENT","amount":24576},{"status":"PLANNING","amount":33143},{"status":"COMPLETED","amount":27557},{"status":"DROPPED","amount":719},{"status":"PAUSED","amount":1391}]},"isRecommendationBlocked":false,"recommendations":[{"mediaRecommendation":{"id":99263,"title":{"romaji":"Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari","english":"The Rising of the Shield Hero","native":"盾の勇者の成り上がり","userPreferred":"Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari"}}},{"mediaRecommendation":{"id":9253,"title":{"romaji":"Steins;Gate","english":"Steins;Gate","native":"シュタインズ・ゲート","userPreferred":"Steins;Gate"}}},{"mediaRecommendation":{"id":21234,"title":{"romaji":"Boku Dake ga Inai Machi","english":"ERASED","native":"僕だけがいない街","userPreferred":"Boku Dake ga Inai Machi"}}},{"mediaRecommendation":{"id":21613,"title":{"romaji":"Youjo Senki","english":"Saga of Tanya the Evil","native":"幼女戦記","userPreferred":"Youjo Senki"}}},{"mediaRecommendation":{"id":9756,"title":{"romaji":"Mahou Shoujo Madoka☆Magica","english":"Puella Magi Madoka Magica","native":"魔法少女まどか☆マギカ","userPreferred":"Mahou Shoujo Madoka☆Magica"}}},{"mediaRecommendation":{"id":101291,"title":{"romaji":"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai","english":"Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai","native":"青春ブタ野郎はバニーガール先輩の夢を見ない","userPreferred":"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai"}}},{"mediaRecommendation":{"id":20832,"title":{"romaji":"Overlord","english":"Overlord","native":"オーバーロード","userPreferred":"Overlord"}}},{"mediaRecommendation":{"id":21860,"title":{"romaji":"Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka?
